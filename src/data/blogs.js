          <li><strong>Your core values:</strong> What matters most to you?</li>
          <li><strong>Your strengths:</strong> What skills, knowledge, or experiences set you apart?</li>
          <li><strong>Your audience:</strong> Who are you trying to reach or influence?</li>

        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn: For professional networking and industry thought leadership</li>
          <li>Twitter/X: For real-time conversations and sharing insights</li>

          <li>Personal stories: Share experiences and lessons learned</li>
          <li>Engagement posts: Ask questions, run polls, or spark discussion</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Being inconsistent:</strong> Posting irregularly or sending mixed messages can confuse your audience.</li>
          <li><strong>Copying others:</strong> Authenticity is key. Don’t mimic someone else’s brand — highlight what makes you unique.</li>
          <li><strong>Neglecting engagement:</strong> Ignoring comments or DMs sends the message that you’re not interested in your audience.</li>
        </ul>`,

        <p>Remember, you don’t need to figure it all out at once. Start small, learn as you go, and enjoy the process of shaping your unique digital presence.</p>`,
